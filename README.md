- Inspiration of the UI was taken from this picture:

- Was made in two days and was actually really enjoyable even though it was quite simple.
- Reused some of my assets from my previous GalleryApp and modified them to suit my fit.

- All code logic is again behind MainWindow.cs, so haven't learned MVVM yet.
  Gets quite messy but all of it is commented and organized.
